//Shortlived_access_tokens_+_refresh_strategy

/*
- Short-Lived Access Tokens + Refresh Token Strategy in JWT 
â€” one of the most widely used, secure authentication mechanisms today. 
- This is a stateless and scalable solution used by Google, Facebook, 
and many modern APIs.
*/
/*
Why this strategy?
To minimize the impact of:
                          Token theft
                          Session hijacking
                          Long-lived tokens being misused
