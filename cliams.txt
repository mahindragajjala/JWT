In JWT (JSON Web Token), 
Claims in JWT tokens carry information about the 
user, 
permissions, and the 
token's validity. 
They are essential for authenticating and authorizing requests 
in a secure and stateless way.


There are three types of claims in JWT:
                        1. Registered Claims (Standard)
                        2. Public Claims
                        3. Private Claims



🔹 1. Registered Claims (Standard)
       These are predefined claims recommended by the JWT 
       specification (RFC 7519). 
       They provide commonly used fields to describe the token.
 Claim                    Description                                 
 `iss` (Issuer)           Who issued the JWT (e.g., auth server name) 
 `sub` (Subject)          Whom the JWT is about (e.g., user ID)       
 `aud` (Audience)         Who the JWT is intended for                 
 `exp` (Expiration Time)  When the JWT will expire                    
 `nbf` (Not Before)       Token is not valid before this time         
 `iat` (Issued At)        When the JWT was issued                     
 `jti` (JWT ID)           Unique identifier for the JWT               

✅ These are optional but recommended for proper JWT management and validation.





2. Public Claims
    These are custom claims defined by users that can be 
    shared publicly.
    They should be registered in the IANA JWT registry to avoid 
    collisions.

      {
      "name": "Mahindra",
      "role": "admin"
      }



3. Private Claims
                Private claims are custom claims agreed upon between 
                the parties (client and server). 
                They are not registered and not standardized.
                {
                  "user_id": "123456",
                  "tier": "premium",
                  "access_scope": "read:users write:files"
                }
✅ These are used for application-specific logic and are only
    ameaningful within your system.

1. Identity Verification
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "Mahindra"
2. Token Validity (Time-based)
  "exp": 1710000000,
  "iat": 1700000000
3. Access Control / Authorization
  "role": "admin",
  "scope": "read:users write:files"
4. Stateless Session Management
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "logged_in": true
5. Multitenancy and Audience Targeting
  "aud": "client-abc",
  "tenant": "companyX"
6. Preventing Replay Attacks
  "jti": "abc123-def456"
