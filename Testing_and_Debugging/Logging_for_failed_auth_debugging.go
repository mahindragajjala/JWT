It‚Äôs essential for both development and production troubleshooting.

//Go JWT Validation With Logging
üõ°Ô∏è Production Logging Best Practices:
- Never log the entire JWT token ‚Äî only parts like sub, 
  exp, iat, or error types.
- Use structured logging libraries (logrus, zap, zerolog) 
  for better filtering.
Redact sensitive fields (email, roles, access level).
