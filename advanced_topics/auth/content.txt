A complete Go microservices JWT demo (auth + service).

                🔐 Auth service: issues JWT
                👤 User service: verifies JWT
                🛒 Cart service: verifies JWT
                📦 Order service: verifies JWT
                💳 Payment service: verifies JWT
                🔔 Notification service: optional


 Microservice                 Responsibility                                                                 
 ✅ Auth Service          Handles user login, registration, and issues JWTs (signed with private key).   
 ✅ User Service          Manages user profile data; verifies JWT using the public key.                  
 🛒 Cart Service          Manages items added to user's cart; uses JWT to authorize user actions.        
 📦 Order Service         Handles order placement, history, tracking; uses JWT to get user identity.     
 💳 Payment Service       Processes payments and confirms transactions; uses JWT to authenticate user.   
 📬 Notification Service  Sends SMS/email updates (order placed, delivered, etc). Uses user ID from JWT. 
 📈 Analytics Service     Gathers behavioral/user activity; may extract user info from JWT if needed.    



🔗 How JWT Ties Them All Together
    - All services use JWT verification middleware 
      (public key validation).
    - Every request includes a JWT in the Authorization: 
      Bearer <token> header.
    - Services don’t need to talk to Auth Service to validate tokens
      — just verify with public key.

🔐 Key Setup (once)
Run this once in the root directory:
# Generate private key
openssl genrsa -out auth-service/private.key 2048

# Generate public key from private key
openssl rsa -in auth-service/private.key -pubout -out user-service/public.key
cp user-service/public.key cart-service/
cp user-service/public.key order-service/
cp user-service/public.key payment-service/



Testing :
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"mahindra"}'

Use JWT on other services
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8001/profile
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8002/cart
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8003/orders
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8004/pay
