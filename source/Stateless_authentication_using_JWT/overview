Stateless authentication means:
- server does not store any session information.
- Instead, it trusts the data inside the JWT token, which is sent with every request.
- The client stores the token (usually in localStorage or cookies) and 
  sends it with each request (usually in the Authorization header).

                          | Client |             |  Server     |
                          +--------+             +-------------+
                               |                        |
                               |   1. Login Request     |
                               |----------------------->|  
                               |                        |
                               |   2. Verify credentials|
                               |                        |
                               |   3. Create JWT        |
                               |<-----------------------|
                               |  JWT: token123         |
                               |                        |
                               | 4. Store JWT (localStorage)  
                               |                        |
                               | 5. Request with JWT     |
                               |----------------------->|  ----> (Authorization: Bearer token123)
                               |                        |
                               | 6. Validate token (stateless)  
                               | 7. Send Protected Data |
                               |<-----------------------|
âœ… At step 6, server does NOT check any session â€” it just verifies the JWT signature and expiry.

ðŸŽ« Stateless Example: JWT Token
You log in and get a signed JWT.
That token contains your identity and expiry.
On every request, you send the token.
The server:
          verifies the token signature âœ…
          trusts its contents âœ…
          processes the request âœ…

Server does not store session or any user data in memory.
ðŸ‘‰ This is stateless.
