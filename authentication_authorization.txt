ONLINE BANKING:

                      Authentication:
You open the banking site and enter your username & password. 
Then, maybe an OTP is sent to your phone.
üîí You are now authenticated.

                      Authorization:
If you're a regular customer, you can view your account, transfer money.
If you're a bank manager, you can also approve loans and view customer data.
So the same login page gives access based on who the person is and 
what role/permissions they have.
